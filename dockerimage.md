# Setting Docker Images to Autograder

  * Simply create a docker image. Autolab links to docker and can access the images right away.



# Installing programs
  * ```apt install``` is very handy
  * ```python3.9 -m pip``` when ```pip``` does not work (for the right python version.)
  
# Fix image to have ```python``` for any version
